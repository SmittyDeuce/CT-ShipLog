One important tip is how to properly hold a compass which is to 
hold it flat on your palm and in front of your chest.

Another tip is that the needle that moves is magnetic North which 
is 11 degrees from tilt of Earth's axis and as many as 20 degrees
different in some places than true north.
    True North is the point at which all longitudinal lines meet
    on the map, at the North Pole.
